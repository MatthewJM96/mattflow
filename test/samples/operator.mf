// NOTE(Matthew): this feature is speculative as it is not clear if it will mess up the
//                grammar immediately, and without an extended character set support
//                beyond [a-zA-Z0-9_] for identifiers it is hard to imagine a major
//                benefit.

// op defaults to lower precedence than intrinsic unary operators, with right
// associativity when function takes one parameter, and to higher precedence than
// intrinsic unary operators but lower than intrinsic binary operators with left
// associativity when the function takes two parameters. In both cases, the operator
// defaults to being higher associativity than the assignment operator.
//
// This can be customised however, consider:
//   op([<,>],INTRINSIC_OP)
// here the first parameter (either "<" or ">") refers to the associativity of the
// operator, while the second is any valid intrinsic operator.
//
// Associativity can be specified without specifying precedence by omitting the second
// parameter:
//   op(<)
// while precedence can be specified without associativity with the ommission of the
// first but inclusion of the comma:
//   op(,+)
